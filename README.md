# Cpp
A sample of applicable programs used to develop my C++ literacy

DragForceSimulation.cpp uses discrete event simulation to calculate the initial velocity of an object undergoing air resistance needed to land at specific point given a target and an angle.

StatisticsFileOutput.cpp can read data from an input file (in this case grades and student numbers) sorting through invalid entries
and compute the mode, minimum, maximum, average, population standard deviation, sample standard deviation and compute the grades
into histograms creating a new file witht the data output.

SlidingWindowStats.cpp is able to compute statistics of quasi-sinusoidal data, that ranges over some period of
time between a minimum and a maximum. Givin a window size it can produce the min, max, average, sample standard deviation and
median of incoming data.
